# paper-to-pad
Sync instapaper pages to a remarkable tablet

# Intended usage:

This is intended to be a command line tool that will:
* grab instapaper pages with the api
* convert the readable version to pdf
* sync it with a folder in Remarkable Cloud

# Possible extensions
* Syncing read progress between instapaper and remarkable
* Syncing favorites or tags
* Is move tracking hard? (Maybe both apis have stable file identifiers?)
